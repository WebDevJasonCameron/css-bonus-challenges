# Lesson's Learned

## 2022 02 21 | First 'Simple' Challenge
Completed the First Project!!!  During this Ex, we were tasked to create a "Coming Soon" page.  It is regarded as a "simple" project.  However, I did learn a lot of interesting things while working on the page.  First, I needed to create a black "banner" above and below the main page.  I thought I should do this with margin, but that only caused the page scroll to show when the main section was larger than the page.  This was not desired.  I figured that I could add a border top and bottom of a hundred px (black) to get the desired results. Then, I could set the main section to take up the vp height.  Result: no scroll.  Second, I added the JS to the actual page.  While the code is a little confusing, I think I can understand what it is doing.  The results of the code is used in the HTML document to show "how many days are left."  The deadline is currently set to New Years Eve of 2023 (2022 12 31 2359.59).  When the time is up, the text will change to "It is here!"

Looking through this, I believe I will need to complete the lessons in our current curriculum.  This will be something to work on during the three-day weekends.

# CSS Bonus Challenges

This repo contains various example UI's that may be used to practice HTML and CSS styling. The UI's are roughly grouped by level of complexity. No CSS frameworks should be used. Using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and SASS will be helpful but not required. For determining colors, if using a Mac, use the Digital Color Meter to determine the correct color. Again, no CSS frameworks should be used but building a custom grid system may be helpful. 

Each example UI contains images needed, a list of formal specifications, and in some cases, a GIF to illustrate functionality. Additional fonts and icons may need to be imported.
